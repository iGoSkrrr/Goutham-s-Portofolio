My dream vacation.<br>
A world full of joy and amusement rides...DISNEY LAND!!

    </h2>
    <h3>
A place Where children/adults scream of joy in the rollercoasters!!


    </h3>
    <article>
<p>A Wonderland full of very exciting rides.<br>  

Its home to mickey mouse, cinderella, and the list continues..
but what fascinates me the most is      
the rides of terror,
such as the ride that goes round and round but super fast..Gives me the chills as I talk about it :0
So many options to have fun!! Go Eat GrEaT food that you might have never tasted before, snorkelling, ice caving, rock climbing, water rafting, watching or you can enter a star wars ship replicaa!!
